# Web Namespace Registry
A registry for namespaces for custom elements, data attributes, custom attributes and css properties.   
So that collisions do not occur.

## Check if a namespace is used

)

## Add your own framework
Make a fork, extend registry.v1.json and make a pull request.

## A project-specific namespace?
Can we agree on a project-specific namespace?  
This should not be used for frameworks, so it can be used in a project without hesitation.  
So far I have always used "cd", (customer data) but maybe another one is more suitable.  

- c- (customer)
- p- (project)
- ps- (project specific)  

What is your opinion?
